1. Prompts you with input int terminal asking for party code, also opens up selenium window (You can navigate to the bomb party game yourself through the window)
2. Asks you to enter f or p for the different iframes. You can inspect page and command F and search iframe, then read the url and if it's falcon, type f, else type P
3. It should run properly! It will type the letters with delay to simulate real person. Still crashes occasianally.
